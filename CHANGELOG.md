### IMPORTANT

- We have updated this product from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 4, so in essence, this is a new product
- For this, we have followed the guidelines from [here](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/migrating/) and [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/)
- We also did not add Bootstrap variables as part of our styles (we will do so in one of our next updates, probably in version 3.0.0 when we'll add Bootstrap 5)

### Bug fixing

- Renamed all files to `.js`, instead of `.jsx`
- Refactor all files from class components to functional ones, so now, you can use React Hooks

### Warning

**The TypeScript and jQuery dependencies are installed only to stop console warnings on install. They are not actually used in our product. So the product is not based on TypeScript or jQuery!**
_The following warnings will appear when running the installation command, but they do not affect the UI or the functionality of the product (they will be solved in our next update):_

```
npm WARN react-chartist@0.14.3 requires a peer of react@^0.14.9 || ^15.0.0 || ^16.0.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
npm WARN react-popper@1.3.7 requires a peer of react@0.14.x || ^15.0.0 || ^16.0.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
npm WARN create-react-context@0.3.0 requires a peer of react@^0.14.0 || ^15.0.0 || ^16.0.0 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.
```

_If they will persist in our 2.4.\* version, we will drop their usages and replace them with other plugins._
_In development mode, some of the above plugins will throw a warning because they still use React v16 syntax. If the error will persist in our 2.4.\* version, we will drop their usage and replace them with other plugins._

### Upgrade details
